**Abstract:**
In this study, we have done a comparison among different machine learning algorithms to develop a model to identify ratoon, expansion, under renovation, and renovated
sugarcane areas using basic statistics metrics from the OLI/Landsat-8 time-series data, along with the data from SRTM. this study was in a region among São Paulo and Minas Gerais states for the crop-season 2020/21. We have used three datasets, one balanced and the others not. Our methodology has the potential to separate the proposal sugarcane classes. Also, feature selection is an important step to decrease the computational cost and improve the model accuracies. The approach to generate simple statistical metrics based on time windows is useful because we can reduce the size of our data and help us summarize all the variability of the interesting areas in these different periods.

**Abstract:**
The São Francisco River basin covers an area of 645.000 km2 corresponding to 8% of Brazilian territory. Located in the Lower-Middle part of São Francisco River basin and in the biome of Caatinga, the Garças, the Pontal and the Curaçá river sub-basins are known for the strong irrigated agriculture, especially, the fruticulture. Many of those irrigated areas were implemented in natural vegetation areas. Due to the higher water demand, it can have changes in the water fluxes, as also in the carbon and energy fluxes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate how landcover and land use change impacts in the carbon and water fluxes, as also in the land surface temperature and surface albedo, using MODIS dataset and the algorithm METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration with High Resolution and Internalized Calibration). The used dataset were: MCD43A3 (albedo), MCD43A4 (nadir adjusted reflectance), MOD11A1 (land surface temperature), MOD15A2H (leaf area index), MOD13A31 (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index – NDVI), MOD16A2 (evapotranspiration – ET), MOD17A2H (gross primary productivity – GPP) and MOD44W (land water mask). The landcover and land use was mapped by visual inspection the main use and land cover in the area to extract the temporal profiles using images from OLI/Landsat-8 availables at Google Earth Engine. There was used the cummulative precipitation images from the TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) data set 3B43, the landcover product MapBiomas version 3.0 and the elevation digital model GMTED2010. After applied the model METRIC to obtain ETa, some of the METRIC sub-products were used as input to generate the GPP and after the water-use efficiency (WUE). After the validation of the generated products using data from micrometerology towers, we not recommended using WUE from the ratio between the MODIS products (MOD17A2H/MOD16A2), as also MOD15A2H and MOD16A2 to study the pixel values, but the penultimate can be used to study the trends. Among the MODIS products, it is recommended to use MCD43A3 and MOD11A1. The products derived from METRIC showed the best results. These products are recommend in studies about carbon and water fluxes, but it is necessary to pay attention to the algorithm calibration of the algorithm to obtain good results. About the behaviour of the studied fluxes in the study area, it was observed a strong dependence of the Caatinga vegetation and pasture areas to the rainfall periods. Differently of irrigated areas, which presented a constant behaviour during the time. The Caatinga vegetation and pasture areas, even suffered a period of lower rainfall events in a period between June/2015 and December/2015 showed high values of NDVI and WUE after the precipitation events from January/2016. The irrigated areas showed high values of GPP and WUE during the whole year.
