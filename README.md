**Abstract:**
In this study, we have done a comparison among different machine learning algorithms to develop a model to identify ratoon, expansion, under renovation, and renovated
sugarcane areas using basic statistics metrics from the OLI/Landsat-8 time-series data, along with the data from srtm. this study was in a region among SÃ£o Paulo and Minas Gerais states for the crop-season 2020/21. We have used three datasets, one balanced and the others not. Our methodology has the potential to separate the proposal sugarcane classes. Also, feature selection is an important step to decrease the computational cost and improve the model accuracies. The approach to generate simple statistical metrics based on time windows is useful because we can reduce the size of our data and help us summarize all the variability of the interesting areas in these different periods.
